# Join - Project Management Tool

**Join** is a project management tool designed to visualize the status and responsibilities of tasks. It helps to keep track of projects and their progress, and clearly assigns tasks.

## Installation

## Frontend

1. Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Saez24/Join_Frontend
cd Join_Frontend

2. Open the index.html file with a Live Server. (You can use the Live Server in Visual Studio Code or another editor.)

**Note**: No further steps are needed for the frontend.

## Backend

1. Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Saez24/Join_Backend
cd Join_Backend

2. Install the dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Create a superuser to access the admin panel:

bash
python manage.py createsuperuser

4. Start the server:

bash
python manage.py runserver

## Usage

**Frontend**: The frontend is developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including index.html). It visualizes the tasks and their statuses. You can simply start and use it via the Live Server.

**Backend**: The backend is developed with Python and Django. It uses the Django REST Framework to provide the API. You can access the admin panel after creating the superuser via the admin/ path.

## Technologies
